# DCS Template
This is a template repository for developing EPICS IOCs for the Detector Control System (DCS) of the Mu2e Experiment. To
make use of this template, click on the green `Use this template` box on the GitHub webpage. Instructions for how to use
this repository and the tools within are found in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md). You will then be asked to give
your new repository a name. It is recommended to choose a name that reflects where this repo will be hosted. For
example, "Tracker LV BeagleBone0" or "ExtMon PIB02".

## Update me!
When a template is made, every file will get copied word-for-word, so you will have to edit this README. Try to write it
so that it becomes a helpful introduction to what your code will do. Remember, better documentation means people won't
have to bug you at 3am when something breaks on shift! Here are some suggestions:
- Change "DCS Template" to the name of your new repo
- Briefly describe the IOCs included

It is recommended to put detailed documentation inside of `.md` files in the `docs` folder.

## More coming soon!
